            </div>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In our solar system there are eight planets and the sun.Earth is the 3rd planet as per it's distance from the Sun.it is the fifth largest planet and looks blue from space.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Earth is the only known living planet in the universe.Earth is home for millions of species including humans.Its about 5 billion years old and within its first billion years of formation, life appeared on Earth's surface. About 71% of the surface is covered by life giving water and the rest by continents and islands. Earth's interior is divided into three layers-A thick layer of solid mantle, a liquid outer core generating magnetic field and solid iron inner core. Earth's surface has several rigid segments or tectonic plates which are slowly but constantly moving.The Earth is a sphere, tilted about 230 degree on its axis and rotating, thus resulting in seasons. It revolves around the sun in about 365.26 days. The Moon is it's only natural satellite which revolves around it, creating oceanic tides and stabilizing the axial tilt</p>

                <p><i><b>Birth of the Earth</b></i></p>
            </div>
                <p>There are many theories as to how the Earth was born. The most commonly accepted one is that the solar system began when a huge old star exploded and heavy elements like carbon, lithium, etc. Flew off in to space and got mixed with hydrogen. The mixture of these gases became a nebula from which the Earth and other planets were formed. Gradually the rapidly expanding nebula cooled down, contracted and started spinning and became a disk called the solar nebula. Most of the mass concentrated at the centre, resulting in pressure and creating a lot of heat, thus the liquid core. Away from the centre, where it was cooler, a whirlpool formed, the debris became sand like grains, collided and stuck together. Bit by bit this built up the huge mass of the planets. It is estimated to have taken about 100 million years to complete the formation of the Earth</p>

                <p><i><b>Composition of the Earth</b></i></p>
                
            </div>
            <p>The Earth is rocky unlike other planets, which are largely gaseous. It s considerably large with the highest density, strongest gravity and the strongest magnetic field amongst the other planets, in our solar system.</p>
            <div class="subheadPlanets">
                <p><i><b>Shape</b></i></p>    
            </div>  
            <p>The Earth is not a perfect sphere. It has a unique shape called a geoid. It rotates at a high speed, creating a bulge around its equator. The lengthof the equator is thus longer than the distance between the two poles.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The highest point on the surface of the Earth is Mount Everest (8,848 meters above sea level) and the lowest is Mariana Trench (10,911 meters below sea level).</p>
            <div class="subheadPlanets">
                <p><i><b>Inside the Earth</b></i></p>    
            </div>  
            <p>Broadly distinguishing, it has three layers divided chemically. The Crust is where we stand. It is a thin cover, most of which is under the ocean as the Earth is covered majorly by water and rest as continents. More than 80% of the Earth's total volume and more than half of its mass is a highly viscous mantle. The Core is primarily made of iron and nickel. the outer core is molten and the inner is solid</p>
            <div class="headPlanets">
                <p><i><b>Shifting Continents</b></i></p>
            </div>
                <p>There are seven continents in the world today. They are Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Austrailia and Antarctia. They are seperated by vast water bodies called Oceans. But it was not always like this. Around 220 million years ago it was a huge single super continent called Pangaea. As the Earth's crust was always moving the Pangaea broke into two continents - Laurasia in the north and Gondwanaland in the south. This breaking process continued and eventually the seven continents came to being. The continents explains how totally different lands with very diverse conditions have the same fossils. There are simiarities in rocks found in Nambia in Africa and Brazil in South America and so on. By the same logic, millions of years from now the Earth migth end up looking completely different from what it is at present. Continents may merge segregate from each other. Oceans may become larger or disappear altogetther. Permian period was around 250 million years ago. Permian lasted for approximately 40 million years. Land was mostly covered with forests and the trees almost used to look like dwarf pine trees. The fossils of these trees in present have become the largest source of coal.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Triassic was around 200 million years ago. It is difficult to say for exactly how many million era lasted. Corals made their first appearance on Earth during this time. So did some flowering plants and the first flying vertebrates.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> The Jurassic period was around 135 million years ago. It is popularly remembered as the 'age of dinosaurs'. The Jurassic was named so because of the exposure of the Jura  Mountains, where Germany, Switzerland and France meet today. A lot of fishes and sea reptiles envolved during this period. Because of the warm and humid atmosphere of the Earth, lush green jungles were formed with large trees.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The Cretaceous period was approximately 65 million years ago. A lot of animals and plants came to an extinction. Thus this period is also called the era of mass extinction. Scientists say that most of the amphibians of this era survived and are evolving till date. Most importantly, by the end of this era more land surfaced and there was a huge downfall in the sea level.</p>

                    <p><i><b>Orbit and Rotation of the Earth</b></i></p>
                </div>
                <p>The Earth rotates from east to west on its axis. While doing so, one half of the Earth faces the Sun and the other half faces away from the Sun, thus causing day and night respectively. Earth completes one rotation in 24 hours in a day.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Different parts of the world have different times of the day at exactly the same moment. When the people in asia starts their day in the morning, Europeans go to sleep and people in United States of America have their evening tea at the same moment.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Ancient people like the Egyptians had their own beliefs about the existance of night and day. Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 first published the correct theory about the Earth orbiting the Sun, thereby causing night and day. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>While standing on the crust of the Earth we do not feel that it is moving. But the Earth is constantly revolving around the Sun at a speed of 30 km/second while rotating on its axis It takes approximately 365.25 days to make a full circle around the Sun from a distance of 150 million km away from its orbit. As the path of the orbit is not perfect but an oval shape, therefore the Earth is closer to the Sun  at one point than another. Its closest point is called the perihelion (happens around January) and its furthest point is called aphelion (happens around July).</p>

                    <p><i><b>Seasons</b></i></p>
                </div>
                <p>The Earth does not spin upright It is tilted at an angle. When the Earth is on one side of the Sun and the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it gets more sunlight and thus experiences summer. At the same time, the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun bringing winter. Similarly when the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it's summer and winter in the northern hemisphere.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>In between, neither hemisphere is tilted more towards the Sun They are known as the <b>Equinoxes</b> (the Longest Day, the Longest Night - one in July, other in september), when both hemispheres receive equal sunlight and cause spring and autumn, which is neither too hot nor too cold. This is how we have seasons around the world. Depending on the location of any place on The Earth it has longer or shorter seasons</p>
